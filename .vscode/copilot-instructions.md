 - Some tools run asynchronously; if you need to review previous outputs, pause new tool calls until needed.

4. Illustrative Examples
 - When in doubt or when clarifying your approach, provide a brief explanation along with the tool call (e.g., "Let me find the function foo..." then call the corresponding search tool).

## Memory Retrieval detailed in [Memory-MCP-Tools](./tools/Memory-MCP-Tools.md):
1. At the beginning of each conversation, start with “Remembering…” and retrieve all relevant abstract information from your knowledge graph, including overall architecture rules, naming conventions, and implementation guidelines for tests, services, controllers, repositories, configurations, and endpoints. Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory".
2. Memory:
While conversing with the user, record any new abstract information relevant to the project, such as:
 - a Guidelines or conventions for implementing tests (e.g., preferred test frameworks, naming conventions, mocks, and integration patterns).
 - b Patterns and best practices for services, controllers, repositories, and configurations (including dependency injection, layering, and bean definitions).
 - c Naming conventions for endpoints, including RESTful design guidelines and URI structures.
 - d Any architectural decisions or abstract patterns the team uses throughout the codebase.
3. Memory Update:
Whenever new information is gathered during the conversation, update your memory by:
 - a Creating or modifying abstract entities for tests, services, controllers, repositories, configurations, and endpoints.
 - b Establishing relationships between these entities to represent how different layers and components interact.
 - c Storing abstract guidelines and observations about preferred practices and naming conventions for future reference.

## Search and Information Gathering
You have tools to search the codebase and read files, as well as tools like context7 MCP to retrieve documentation from the internet. Follow these guidelines when calling tools:

1. Heavily prefer the semantic search tool (e.g., `search_in_files_content`) over grep-based searches, file searches, or directory listings.
2. When reading files, retrieve larger sections at once rather than multiple smaller calls to reduce the number of tool invocations.
3. Once you find a reasonable location for edits or answers, avoid further tool calls and proceed using the information you have gathered.

If you are unsure about the USER's request or if the retrieved details do not fully address the query, gather more information by making additional tool calls or asking clarifying questions calling interactive MCP tools.
Bias towards solving the request internally using available tools without asking the USER for help, unless all available tools are exhausted.

## Implement changes in the code
When making changes to the code, follow these guidelines:
1. **General Guidelines for Code Changes**
   - **Commenting:** All methods and attributes in any modified or created class must have JavaDoc comments in English.
   - **No "Existing Code" Comments:** When applying changes via MCP tools, include the entire code instead of using placeholder comments like "existing code."
   - **Before run anything check errors** Before excute the code or test, you have to call the tools `get_current_file_errors` and `get_project_problems`, if there are errors you have to fix it and then run the code.
   - **Test Changes:** If you are creating or modifying test classes/methods, run the tests immediately. If they fail, iterate until they pass.
   - **Tool Preference:** If the class already exists, use targeted tools such as `replace_specific_text` and `replace_selected_text` for modifications.
   - **Single Edit Call:** Combine all changes into a single `edit_file` tool call; avoid multiple separate calls.

2. **Do Not Output Code Directly to the USER**
   - Instead of pasting code snippets in your message, use one of the code edit tools (for example, `replace_current_file_text` or `create_new_file_with_text`) to implement the change.
   - Ensure that your changes include all required import statements, dependencies, endpoints, etc., so that the code is immediately runnable.
   - If creating the codebase from scratch, also produce appropriate dependency management files (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven) and a README.

3. **Examples of Using JetBrains MCP Tools**

   - **Replacing Specific Code Sections**
     - *Situation:* You need to update a method in an existing file.
     - *Approach:* 
       - Explain your intention: "I will update the logic of the `calculateTotal` method in `BillingService.java`."
       - Use `replace_specific_text` with parameters:
         - `pathInProject`: e.g., `src/main/java/com/example/service/BillingService.java`
         - `oldText`: the current code block for the method body.
         - `newText`: the updated code block with proper JavaDoc comments.
   
   - **Creating a New File**
     - *Situation:* A new test class is required.
     - *Approach:*
       - Explain your action: "I will create a new test class for `BillingService` using JUnit 5 and Mockito."
       - Use `create_new_file_with_text` with parameters:
         - `pathInProject`: e.g., `src/test/java/com/example/service/BillingServiceTest.java`
         - `text`: The complete file content including package declaration, imports, class definition, test methods, and the usage of `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` and `MockWebServer`.

   - **Replacing the Entire File Content**
     - *Situation:* The user requests a complete rework of a file.
     - *Approach:*
       - Explain: "I will replace the entire content of the current file with the updated implementation."
       - Use `replace_current_file_text` with the new content, ensuring all necessary code, imports, and comments are included.
       - Don't forget to include JavaDoc comments for all methods and attributes.
       - Don't use "existing code" comments; include the full code of the part you are going to edit, keeping the code that does not need to be changed intact

4. **Final Steps After Code Changes**
   - Provide a **BRIEF SUMMARY** of all changes made, emphasizing how they address the USER's task.
   - Checks that the new code has not caused any errors in the project by calling the tools `get_current_file_errors` and `get_project_problems`. If there are errors fix it.
   - If applicable, collect the run configuration using the appropriate MCP tool (e.g., `get_run_configurations`) and then execute the needed configuration using the corresponding tool (e.g., `run_configuration`).

## Debugging Guidelines
When debugging, only make code changes if you are certain that you can solve the problem. Otherwise, follow debugging best practices:
1. Address the root cause instead of the symptoms.
2. Add descriptive logging statements and error messages to track variable and code state.
3. Add test functions and statements to isolate the problem.

## Additional MCP Tools Guidelines and Planning
1. **Prompt Boosting and Sequential Thinking**
   - For complex or lengthy prompts, use the prompt boost tools to improve the user's prompt when needed.
   - If a prompt includes more than 2 tasks, utilize the sequentialthinking tool to divide the work into smaller subtasks and call start_intensive_chat to allocate more computation time.
3. Always use the tools that you need from among the tools available in the 34 JetBrains MCP tools (detailed in [JetBrains-MCP-Tools](./tools/JetBrains-MCP-Tools.md)).
4. When additional context or documentation is required, use the memory tools (detailed in [Memory-MCP-Tools](./tools/Memory-MCP-Tools.md)); if no information is stored, then call the context7 tools to retrieve necessary documentation (never search for Spring Boot reactive documentation).
5. If further details from the user are needed, call the request_user_input tool.
6. Store any relevant information for future reference using the memory tools (detailed in [Memory-MCP-Tools](./tools/Memory-MCP-Tools.md)) so it need not be requested again.
7. After editing and testing the code, add all required JavaDoc comments.

## Reactive programming Guidelines with Webflux

1. **General Principles**
   - Extract as much code as possible into separate methods.
   - Use reactive programming to chain methods, which enhances code readability.
   - By default, all code must be implemented using reactive programming constructs unless the USER specifies otherwise.
