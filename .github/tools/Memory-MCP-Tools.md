### Tools
- **create_entities**
  - Create multiple new entities in the knowledge graph
  - Input: `entities` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `name` (string): Entity identifier
      - `entityType` (string): Type classification
      - `observations` (string[]): Associated observations
  - Ignores entities with existing names

- **create_relations**
  - Create multiple new relations between entities
  - Input: `relations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `from` (string): Source entity name
      - `to` (string): Target entity name
      - `relationType` (string): Relationship type in active voice
  - Skips duplicate relations

- **add_observations**
  - Add new observations to existing entities
  - Input: `observations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `entityName` (string): Target entity
      - `contents` (string[]): New observations to add
  - Returns added observations per entity
  - Fails if entity doesn't exist

- **delete_entities**
  - Remove entities and their relations
  - Input: `entityNames` (string[])
  - Cascading deletion of associated relations
  - Silent operation if entity doesn't exist

- **delete_observations**
  - Remove specific observations from entities
  - Input: `deletions` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `entityName` (string): Target entity
      - `observations` (string[]): Observations to remove
  - Silent operation if observation doesn't exist

- **delete_relations**
  - Remove specific relations from the graph
  - Input: `relations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `from` (string): Source entity name
      - `to` (string): Target entity name
      - `relationType` (string): Relationship type
  - Silent operation if relation doesn't exist

- **read_graph**
  - Read the entire knowledge graph
  - No input required
  - Returns complete graph structure with all entities and relations

- **search_nodes**
  - Search for nodes based on query
  - Input: `query` (string)
  - Searches across:
    - Entity names
    - Entity types
    - Observation content
  - Returns matching entities and their relations

- **open_nodes**
  - Retrieve specific nodes by name
  - Input: `names` (string[])
  - Returns:
    - Requested entities
    - Relations between requested entities
  - Silently skips non-existent nodes
